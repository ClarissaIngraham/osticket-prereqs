<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10</b>


<h2>Installation Steps</h2>
In this tutorial I'm going to walk you through on how to create a virtual machine, install a ticketing system, and setup SQL(Structured Query Language).
<p>
<br />
  
First we will need to create a resource group and a VM(virtual machine) in Microsoft Azure. The reason we are using a VM is because it allows us to safetly install the ticketing system, all while keeping our physical machine protected. In some cases it is also cost-effective.

</p>
<p>
Next you will connect your VM using RDP(Remote Desktop Protocol), which allows you to remotely connect to devices on a network. You will use the VM's public IPv4 address to connect. If you're using a Mac you will need to download the Windows App and then connect your VM.

</p>
<p>
Now within the VM we are going to download the osTicket installation files and upzip them onto the desktop. These files are going to be used to install osTicket on the VM
